            <p>
              My name is Viktoriia. I am Ukrainian and currently living in
              Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like urban legends, Terry Pratchett's works, and coding. This
              year, at age 25, I figured out what I wanted to do in my life and
              decided to become a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in coding started thanks to Tumblr and peaked in high
              school when we had the subject «The basics of programming.» There
              I dealt with languages such as Pascal and Delphi, and I did well.
              I wanted to become a developer in 2014, but due to many factors, I
              abandoned this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, it took me eight years to back to my dream. During
              this time, I experienced one foreign invasion, left one university
              after three years of study, earned a Bachelor's degree in
              sociology at another university, changed several jobs, and left my
              country because of war. I couldn't help thinking I was doing
              something wrong with my life all this time. So there I am again. I
              think, my coming back was similar to

            <h3 class="about-head">What are my career goals?</h3>
            <p>
              My main career goal is to one day become a full-stack developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve my dream, I am going to master the next programming
              languages: Javascript (including React and Vue), Python, PHP, and
              Ruby.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why I chose these languages? Well, there are two reasons. Firstly,
              I often heard about them from many people. Secondly, I picked up a
              few free programming courses, tested my abilities using them, and
              was quite successful. I understand that there are many other
              programming languages, but I've decided to focus on these right
              now. I admit the possibility that if my future employer offers
              something different, I can change my mind.
