            <p>
              My name is Viktoriia. I am Ukrainian and currently living in
              Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like urban legends, conspiracy theories (ironically), cooking,
              and coding. This year, at age 25, I figured out what I wanted to
              do in my life and decided to become a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in coding started thanks to Tumblr and peaked in high
              school when we had the subject «The basics of programming.» There
              I dealt with languages such as Pascal and Delphi, and I did well.
              I wanted to become a developer in 2014, but due to many factors, I
              abandoned this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, it took me eight years to back to my dream. I
              experienced one foreign invasion, left one university after three
              years of study, earned a Bachelor's degree in sociology, changed
              several jobs, and left my country because of war. I couldn't help
              thinking I was doing something wrong with my life. So there I am
              again.
            </p>
            <p>
              I came a long 10-year way to understanding who I am and what I
              want to do in my life. Thanks to my supportive family, I don't
              feel ashamed about it. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's
              the truth.

            <h3 class="about-head">What are my career goals?</h3>
            <p>
              My main career goal is to one day become a full-stack developer.
              And I'm working on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Front-end development is the first reason why I am interested in
              coding. I feel genuine children's joy when my code becomes
              good-looking and works well. I am currently focusing on learning
              Javascript (jQuery and React) and polishing CSS skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using back-end development, I want to prove to myself that I can
              overcome everything. For years, I heard that math is not my thing,
              I don't have to try to change situations, and so on. That's why I
              am working on upgrading my math skills right now. After that, I am
              planning to start learning PHP and Ruby.
