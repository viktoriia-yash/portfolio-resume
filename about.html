            <p>
              I am an Italy-based Ukrainian, currently working on becoming a web
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am 26, like urban legends and Terry Pratchett's works. I finally
              understood what I wanted to do in life at age 25.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in coding started thanks to Tumblr and peaked in high
              school. I wanted to link my life with this sphere in 2014, but due
              to many factors, I abandoned this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, it took me eight years to back to my dream. During
              this time, I left one university after three years of study,
              earned a Bachelor's degree in sociology at another university,
              changed several jobs, and left my country because of war.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this time, I couldn't help thinking I was doing something
              wrong with my life. Only after experiencing a scene similar to
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m7SGjJo7c4&ab_channel=FrancoSeguer"

                >one</a
              >
              episode from "Ratatouille" I understood in which direction to move
              on.

            <h3 class="about-head">What are my career goals?</h3>
            <p>
              My main career goal is to one day become a full-stack developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also includes mastering the following programming languages:
              Angular, #C, PHP, SQL, and Ruby.
            </p>
            <p>
              I admit it's a long journey. But after many attempts, I am pretty
              confident in myself and my abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I understand that there are many other programming languages. If
              my future employer, as part of the internship or something, offers
              to learn a different language, I will focus on it first.
