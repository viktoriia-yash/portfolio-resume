My future portfolio site

I did this project during the "SheCodes Responsive" course. In the future, I am going to use it as my portfolio site. To create it, I used: <br/>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting</li>
</ul>
The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://loquacious-frangipane-fb390e.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> <br/>
My "SheCodes Responsive" certificate you can find here: WIP
