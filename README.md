# My future portfolio site
I did this project during the "SheCodes Responsive" course. In the future, I am going to use it as my portfolio site. To create it, I used: <br/>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting.</li>
</ul>
The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://loquacious-frangipane-fb390e.netlify.app/">Netlify</a> <br/>
My "SheCodes Responsive" certificate you can find here: <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/certificates/b43458f021d6fd49ffbf73b5a7f9a015">SheCodes</a>
